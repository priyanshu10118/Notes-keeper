# Notes-keeper
* This web application keeps the notes.

* The project is built with React as a final project under React section of Angela Yu's Udemy course.

* I have done some changes to it.

* React concepts like- useState, hooks, and managing components were used along with Javascript ES6 concepts including mapping, spread operator, arrow functions, filter, object, etc.

* I have also used MUI dependencies to style the application.
